# ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code,
# with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

# You can tell ESLint to ignore specific files and directories
# by creating an .eslintignore file in your projectâ€™s root directory.
# The .eslintignore file is a plain text file
# where each line is a glob pattern indicating
# which paths should be omitted from linting.
